      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I’m a dedicated professional with a strong background in customer service and a growing focus on IT support. Over the years, I’ve developed solid experience in handling customer needs, solving problems, and delivering excellent service across various roles. While working at Sony Middle East & Africa FZE, I became more involved with IT operations—supporting ticket resolution, CRM troubleshooting, and assisting with Help Desk tasks. This sparked my interest in the technical side of support, leading me to enroll in the Microsoft IT Support Specialist course. I’m now actively building skills in system diagnostics, user support, and troubleshooting, with a clear goal of transitioning into a more technical role while continuing to leverage my customer service strengths.</p>

      <h2>Customer service & IT Journey</h2>
      <p> I’ve always enjoyed helping people and solving problems, which is what first got me into customer service. Over the years, I’ve built a solid background in this field, and it taught me a lot about communication, patience, and finding solutions that work.
        <br>While working at Sony Middle East & Africa FZE, I started getting more involved with the IT side of things—helping with support tickets, CRM issues, and some basic system maintenance.<br>I even got the chance to assist with Help Desk tasks, guiding colleagues through common technical problems. That experience made me realize how much I enjoy working with tech and supporting others in that way. <br>To build on that, I’ve enrolled in the Microsoft IT Support Specialist course, where I’m learning more about system diagnostics, troubleshooting, and day-to-day IT support. I’m really focused on growing in this area and aiming to shift into a more technical support role, combining everything I’ve learned so far from both customer service and IT.
