      <h2>IT & Front-End Development Journey</h2>
      <p>I began my tech journey with a strong interest in front-end development, starting with self-learning in HTML and CSS. I’ve since built and published a basic portfolio website using GitHub Pages, showcasing my early understanding of responsive design, clean layout structure, and user-friendly interface creation. <br>Alongside front-end learning, I’ve also developed an interest in IT support. In my previous roles, particularly at Sony Middle East & Africa FZE, I worked closely with the IT department—supporting ticket resolution, CRM troubleshooting, and system maintenance. I also briefly held a Help Desk support role, assisting with basic issue handling and internal user guidance.
Currently, I’m enrolled in a Microsoft IT Support Specialist course, where I’m continuing to build skills in system diagnostics, user support, and troubleshooting common IT issues. This hands-on experience and continuous learning reflect my commitment to transitioning into a more technical, support-focused career path.</p>
